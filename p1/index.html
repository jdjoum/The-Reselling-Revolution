        <h2>What is a Reseller?</h2>
        <p>A reseller is company or individual (merchant) that purchases goods or services with the intention of selling them rather than consuming or using them.</p>

        <p>Sneaker and reselling culture as I know it began with Michael Jordans's first sneaker, the Air Jordan 1, which was released during his rookie season with the Chicago Bulls in 1985. At the time Jordan was an exceptional player putting up groundbreaking stats, especially considering that he was rookie. <br> Consumers of the time wanted to get their hands on his sneakers because they knew that it would be an item that not only provided sentimental value to them but also monetary value to them in the long-term. Nike, the company that first signed him for a sneaker deal, made the sponsorship official in 1984 right before the Olympic Games. Nike saw the immense potential in the young athelete and wanted to add him to their team officially. But, Nike knew Jordan wasn't just another athelete. He was a superstar. So, they allowed him to have his own signature sneaker which they had never done with an athelete before. Nike, under their umbrella, allowed Jordan Brand to become an entity of its own which progressively revolutionized the sneaker industry as whole over time.Fastforwarding through Jordan's domination of the NBA and acquisition of 6 NBA Championship titles, Jordan Brand would release sneakers every single season. So, that meant every year consumers could get access to the actual shoes that Jordan wore when he accomplished his many great feats. The most popular and coveted of Jordan sneakers, even to this day, are the sneakers that he wore when he won his championship titles. Those sneakers are the Air Jordan 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13. Since most of these shoes originally dropped in the 90's that have been retroed, which means remade in new ways and colors, dozens of times for the kids and consumers of today to enjoy and resell.</p>

         <img src="p1img\polosport.png" style =  "float: right; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 10px;  width: 300px; height: 170px; padding-left: 0px;"> 
        <p>Another set of very important brands that contributed the whole start of the reselling craze around world are Polo Sport and Polo Ralph Lauren. In the 90's the youth and subculture such as Hip-Hop adopted wearing the brands to stand out from all of the sports oriented brands that existed at the time. People would wear and collect whole outfits of Polo Ralph Lauren and walk the streets of New York proud and confident because they were happy with their image and style, which wasn't very popular or common at the time. The difference between Polo Sport and Polo Ralph Lauren is that Polo Sport blended the high fashion design elements of Polo also with the urban flavor of what the people of the 90's loved, which was color. Polo Sport is known for its color blocking. Color blocking is when clothing pieces have different regions of colors exentuating different parts of a piece. For example, the most popular Polo Sport Piece ever is called the Snow Beach Jacket. This Jacket Features yellows sleeves and upper torso, but the bottom of the jacket is navy blue throughout making the jacket stand out. It also feature red bold letters that spell "SNOW BEACH" on the chest adding another color and element to the design. Since this Jacket was produced in very limited stock in the 90's versions of it today can sell for over $1000. I know it sounds crazy, but some people will do anything to get their hands on clothes that they can be certain that no one else has.</p>

        <p>Finally, we can get into Supreme which is by far the most popular streetwear/fashion/skate/hypebeast brand that is resold on the market today. Supreme began as simple and small little skate brand on Lafayette St. in downtown New York in 1994. The special and unique thing about them is that it began as a hub for skaters to actually meet up and hangout and not as the ambitious fashion empire that it has become today. The original layout of the Supreme store had all the clothing racks located to the walls of the store, which was pretty abnormal for a store that was trying to make a clothing business, because they wanted skaters to be able to skate inside of their store without running into racks and racks of clothes to be able to kick it. Supreme's first ever design is the same design that they use today and it is considered a classic. Supreme's box logo design is made up of a red rectangle with the word "Supreme" written in bold futura font. Supreme actually stole this concept from an artitst at the time named... who used the same font and rectangles to promote her journalism artworks and critiques. Supreme put their box logo on t-shirts back in 1994, and it slowly became a pop culture thing on its own always selling out. One of the most unique things with Supreme is that they never release the same thing that they have released before ever again, so once something sells out it's gone. Which is why an after market for the brand developed in the first place. People who are unable to have access to Supreme clothes, whether it's because they're across the world or located in some country town in the US, were willing to pay a higher price than retail for those items creating a business for Supreme sellers to make profit from. This whole concept still amazes and excites me to this day and I really enjoy getting to take a part in the reselling and fashion culture of today with brands like Supreme, Nike, and much more. Proving that a hobby of buying and sellinig clothes isn't just a waste of time, but it has and always will have the potential to become a business if you're willing to put the work required into it.</p>

        <h2>The Modern Reseller &#38; Reselling With The Internet</h2>
        <p>The modern reseller has many avenues to use to sell their products to buyers online. Some of which include Ebay, Grailed, Stockx, Facebook, and Instagram. <br><br> </p>
            <img src="p1img\ebay.png" style =  "float: right; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 10px;  width: 200px; height: 120px; padding-left: 0px;"> 
        <p>Ebay is one of the most common online marketplaces where resellers sell their stock for profit. The major advantage of using it today is the fact that sellers can have access to Ebay's giant spread of users for free and with ease. All an Ebay Seller has to do is take high quality pictures of their item, provide a good and accurate description of the item's condition and size, and sit back and wait for Ebay's algorithm to do its thing and find them a buyer. But, to be a professional Ebay seller it takes a lot of hard work and skill. The best sellers on Ebay post new items every single day and have tactics like using standout keywords to boost their listings viewing potential. The modern reseller should be taking advantage of Ebay's perks to increase the success of their reselling business.</p>
            <p style= "font-size: 12px";>Source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay" style = "font-size: 12px;">Ebay Logo</a></p>
                
        <img src="p1img\grailed.jpg" style =  "float: right; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 10px;  width: 150px; height: 150px; padding-left: 0px;">     
        <p>Grailed is another commonly used online marketplace for resellers and buyers to conduct business. It was founded in 2014, by Arun Gupta and Jake Metzger whose goal was to develop an app to compete with the likes of other online marketplaces like Ebay. But, the difference is that their major focus was on creating a higher class online marketplace that brought high fashion to their wide variety of everyday users. To be honest, they were pretty successful at this because they were the first ever reselling app to organize their clothing categories by brand, and not just the style of the item. This new method proved to help them because the youth of today is heavily brand focused and when they open the app they can immediately find clothes from their favorite brands easily without having to type them into the search engine. Grailed has  a multitude of brands and designers ranging from Louis Vuitton to Gucci to Burberry, and even lesser known ones such as Off-White, A Bathing Ape, and Raf Simons. Grailed tries to provide something for everyone, and does a great job of allowing sellers to caterogorize their items by brand and designer simplistically. Grailed is  another great asset that should be used by the modern reseller to specificallt target buyers who are loyal to certain brands and designers.</p>

         <img src="p1img\stockx.png" style =  "float: right; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 10px;  width: 150px; height: 150px; padding-left: 0px;">      
        <p>Stockx is the newest and most developed of all the reselling apps out there and it has completly changed the reselling game. Stockx's initiative is to provide 100% authentic items to buyers who use their app and website at the best price closest to the actual market value. Stockx accomplishes their objective by being the middle man. Stockx connects the seller to the buyer by receiving every single item that eventually makes it to the buyer and authenticates it beforehand by their certified authenticators. Stockx then ships the item to the buyer with one of their special branded tags that proves that the item has gone through the authentication process successfully so the buyer can be at ease. If an item is fake it will not be shipped to the buyer and the seller is banned never being allowed to use their service again. This works well for Stockx because they have very little liability besides making sure their authenticators don't let fakes slip through. And this lets buyers have peace of mind when their purchasing items through Stockx's platform. Another aspect that has attributed to the major success of Stockx is the fact that each of their item listings shows the previous sales of that exact item similar to how the actual stock market works. In addition, they also have graphs showing how items have performed over time visually showing their users whether the item's market value has shot up over time or decreased over time. This stock-like feature had never made its way into the reselling world before Stockx implemented it and it has definetly revolutionized the reselling game in a big way. Stockx has pushed reselling forward by leaps and bounds which is why the modern reseller should make use of its fair and easily accessible selling features. </p>

        <p>To contrary belief, the social media website Facebook is a great way for resllers to connect with each other and sell their items for profit. Facebook has a group feature that allows people with similar niche interests, like sneakers or clothing, to connect with other people all over the world. There are these Facebook groups out there that are specifically for reselling, which can even get as in depth as to only reselling certain brands. So, the modern reseller should be joining Facebook groups to widen their audience and develop relationships with people interested in doing exactly what they love to do.</p>

        <img src="p1img\instagram.jpg" style =  "float: right; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px; margin-left: 10px;  width: 150px; height: 150px; padding-left: 0px;"> 
        <p>On Instagram, a reseller can develop their own brand and an image for themselves that allows buyers, and followers in general, to get to know them more in depth than any other app or website can. On Instagram, it's all about image and what one can portray to their followers. So, if the modern reseller is to have success on Instagram they have to be more than someone who is just trying to sell something to their followers. They have to portray a lifestyle and show their personality, because that is what ultimately will lead to their success on the platform and in their business. Successful Instagram resellers make use of Instagram's hashtag feature, which allows their post to be targeted to the exact buyers that they want. For example, Instagram has really popular hashtags such as, #supreme4sale and #suprememarket which are followed by other resellers and buyers who interact with each other and want to buy and sell supreme items. Ultimately, Instagram is more than just a selling platform because it allows the modern reseller to develop a following of more than just people who are going to potentially buy from them, but an audience that supports them wholeheartedly beyond just their merchandise.</p>

        <h3>Developing Credibility</h3>
        <p>The modern reseller needs to develop credibility because it's what gives buyers assurance that they will be getting the 100% authentic item that they purchased in a timely manner with no hassle. </p>
        
        <h3>Diversifying Clientele</h3>
        <p>In reselling it's very important to diversify your clientele and develop contacts because the more people you know the more potential profit that you can make. That's why successful full-time resellers stress making connections with the people who have bought from them before as one of the key tips for their success. It's much easier to sell to someone who has already bought an item from you before because there is aspect of trust between you and the buyer. But, trying to find new buyers is not as easy because buyers don't know what type of character you have and vice versa. For all they know you could be trying to scam them or they could be trying scam you. For success in reselling you need to develop long-lasting business connections, just like in the professional world, because knowing the people who buy in your market on a personal level gives you an advantage over your competitors. <br><br><br></p>
